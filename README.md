# Crime-Data-Visualisation

This project adopted a mixed-methods approach to comprehensively analyze the intricate relationship between crime incidents and temperature variations within a specific geographical region. Initially, a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase was conducted to gain a deep understanding of the individual datasets and their potential interactions. This phase involved the application of diverse visualization techniques, including, but not limited to, scatter plots to identify potential point-wise relationships, temporal line graphs to observe crime and temperature trends over time, and correlation heatmaps to visualize the strength and direction of linear associations between multiple variables.

Following the EDA, a linear regression model was constructed to formally quantify the relationship between temperature, treated as the independent variable, and crime rates, treated as the dependent variable. This statistical modeling aimed to determine the extent to which temperature fluctuations predict changes in crime rates, while controlling for other potentially influential factors. The model's coefficients were analyzed to assess the magnitude and direction of the relationship, and statistical significance tests were performed to determine the reliability of the observed correlation. Furthermore, residual analysis was conducted to validate the model's assumptions and ensure its suitability for drawing meaningful conclusions. The results of the regression model, along with the insights gleaned from the visualization phase, were then used to infer statistically significant correlations, provide context-specific interpretations, and highlight any potential patterns or trends that may have implications for crime prevention strategies or resource allocation.
